  <p style="color: aqua;" >My country is Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a Southeast Asian country. It is small country but huge population. It gains independence twice. Once from Britain in 1947 and again from Pakistan in 1971. Dhaka is the capital of this country. More than twenty crore people live in our country. Most of them are Muslims. Others are Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Most of the people’s occupation of our country are farmers. Remaining people are doctors, engineers, teachers, businessmen, jobbers etc.</p>
 <p style="color: red;">There are a lot of activities I do when I feel bored. Firstly, I like to practice sports. Sometimes, I play football with my friends outside. At other times, I just stay home playing table tennis with my two brothers. Secondly, when I don’t want to practice anything, I just turn on my laptop and watch some episodes of my favourite series. </p>
